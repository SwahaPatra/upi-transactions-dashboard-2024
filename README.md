UPI Transactions Dashboard 2024:-  
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard I built using a dummy UPI transactions dataset.
The idea was to treat it like a real-world digital payments problem: clean messy raw data, explore trends, and turn it into something that can give business insights at a glance.
